- use the euclidean distance to map to scales that we have defined

Q: should the same input always have the same output? pure function? function of slight randomness?

1. Generate key/scale

2. Hash table of chords and chords that you can lead into (online resource)

3. Loop through chords and possibilites
	need to have reference of emotions that couplet chords invoke as well as individual chords (useful for starting) (everything in roman numeral notation)
	- reference the youtube video that defines these

4. output a roman numeral progression (and 7th/9th etc)

5. map to chords in the key/scale we picked!

- use the euclidean distance to map to scales that we have defined DONE
	- we use this function to determine the distance between different tones that have been analyzed

Q: should the same input always have the same output? pure function? function of slight randomness?

1. Generate key/scale DONE

2. Hash table of chords and chords that you can lead into (online resource)

3. Loop through chords and possibilites
	need to have reference of emotions that couplet chords invoke as well as individual chords (useful for starting) (everything in roman numeral notation)
	- reference the youtube video that defines these

4. output a roman numeral progression (and 7th/9th etc)

5. map to chords in the key/scale we picked!

Alternate idea:

Use hook theory api to make it easier to pick the next chord
	-but need to analyze each chord choice for emotional response to keep consistent!

Another idea: generate random progression!

Ideas
	Pick 1st chords from tone
	get list of chords that can lead to
	of these, pick one with greatest tone match?
	repeat 4x
	
	problem: how to include chord vars: 7th/9th etc

2)	Pick 1st chord from tone
	get list fo chords from hooktheory that follow
	for each - analyze the tone response of the chord (or couplet?)

	hook theory uses major notation - can transpose to relative minor later - add dropdown for key? or random? - needs ui
	get rid of scales and keep only major/minor? determine scale might be useless

- want to use tone - how to analyze pairs of chords and their emotions? keeping a massive map might be the only way?

- maybe start with a random progression based off hooktheory/input?
	- have to protect against loops back to same chord ie i-II-i-II (or maybe not) - randomly add 7th?

later: for transposing progressions to actual chords
	teoria.js, sharp11.js, tonal.js (one of these)

chords <- c("1", "4", "5", "6", "2", "3", "27", "47", "16", "67", "56", "5/6", "b7", "164", "57", "37", "5/5", "464", "17", "664", "564", "46", "57/6", "642", "36", "66", "b6", "b3")
what do these map to? normalized to key of c major



1)generate first chord on key based on tone

2)get list of next chords from hooktheory

3)for each chord, determine interval increase or decrease in the given key and whether major/minor

4)from the table of tones (of major/minor increase decrease)

5) pick closest distance of tone to original

6) repeat 4x, ensuring no duplicated chosen

7) clean/romanize, tranpose to given key, get notes and voice, return
